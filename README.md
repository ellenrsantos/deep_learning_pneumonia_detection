This repository contains a neural network model trained in [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), as well as the files needed to reopen the project and run predictions in Python or JavaScript.

# ðŸ“œ Context:
Pneumonia is an infection in your lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Pneumonia causes your lung tissue to swell (inflammation) and can cause fluid or pus in your lungs. Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe than viral pneumonia, which often resolves on its own.
Pneumonia can affect one or both lungs. Pneumonia in both of your lungs is called bilateral or double pneumonia. 

# ðŸ“– Description:
How is pneumonia diagnosed?

To diagnose pneumonia, a healthcare provider will ask about your health history and conduct a physical exam. Theyâ€™ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and may perform or order additional tests. These include imaging (like chest X-rays), pulse oximetry (checking oxygen levels in your blood), blood tests or sputum (spit) tests.
Even if your healthcare provider confirms that you have pneumonia, sometimes, they canâ€™t find the exact cause.

For this analysis, I chose a open acess dataset available in Mendeley (link below) which contains a large dataset with X-Rays.

# ðŸ§  Methodology & Tools Used:

For this ML Model I used Teachable Machine, is a tool from Google. Teachable Machine is a web-based GUI tool for creating custom machine learning (ML) classification models without specialized technical expertise. We created it to help students, teachers, designers, and others learn about ML by creating and using their own classification models.

# ðŸ’¡ Notes: 

- The project.tm file is useful for reopening and modifying training in Teachable Machine.

- The model.tflite file can be used in Python, Android, or embedded devices.
